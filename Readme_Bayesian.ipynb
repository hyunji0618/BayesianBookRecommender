        "Traditional recommendation systems often rely on the most common items or collaborative filtering techniques, which group users and items based on similarily measures. While these methods can be effective, they struggle in scenarios where data is sparse or user preferences evolve over time, leading to suboptimal recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bayesian collaborative filtering enhances recommendation quality by incorporating probability-based predictions. Rather than solely relying on similarity-based heuristics, this approach estimates the likelihood of a user enjoying an item based on observed ratings and latent factors. A key component of this model is the likelihood function, which captures the probability distribution of observed ratings based on user-item interactions. By leveraging Bayesian principles, the model introduces latent variables to capture hidden factors influencing user preferences and dynamically updates its predictions as new data becomes available, offering a more robust and flexible recommendation framework.\n",

Unlike traditional matrix factorization techniques such as **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, our approach leverages a **Bayesian Network (Bayes Net)** to incorporate user biases, item biases, and latent factors while also quantifying uncertainty in predictions.  \n",

        "\n",
        "We assess our model's performance by evaluating the **predicted ratings** it generates. Due to computational constraints, the Bayesian model was trained using a subset of **1,000 samples** from the dataset, with **800 samples for training** and **200 samples for testing**. The evaluation was conducted on this subset to analyze the model’s effectiveness in making accurate predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Precision**\n",
        "\n",
        "We define a threshold of **7** to classify the numerically predicted ratings as positive or negative and convert the ratings into a binary classification problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive ratings among all predicted positive ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Training set (800 samples):** 60%\n",
        "  - **Test set (200 samples):** 21%\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recall**\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall evaluates the proportion of actual positive ratings that were correctly identified by the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Training set (800 samples):** 61%\n",
        "  - **Test set (200 samples):** 20%\n",
        "\n",
        "**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**\n",
        "\n",
        "RMSE quantifies the difference between predicted and actual ratings, with lower values indicating better prediction accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Training set (800 samples):** 1.44\n",
        "  - **Test set (200 samples):** 2.58\n",
        "\n",
        "Our evaluation indicates that our Bayesian recommendation model performs well on the training data, though its precision and recall drop on the test set. The discrepancy suggests that the model may be overfitting to the training data, limiting the model’s ability to generalize effectively to new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to computational constraints, we trained our model on a subset of the dataset rather than the full dataset. We expect improved model performance when trained with the entire dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, we aim to introduce more evlauation metrics to better assess the relevance of the top-k recommendations generated by our model."

        "\n",
        "- Accurate priors are everything in Bayesian Machine Learning - well-defined priors significantly impact Bayesian model performance.\n",
        "- Hyperparameter tuning should be the final step - optimizing other components first yields better results.\n",
        "- Sampling can be more computationally expensive than you might think.\n",
        "- Model prediction time is nothing to sneeze at! Computational efficiency should never be underestimated.\n",
